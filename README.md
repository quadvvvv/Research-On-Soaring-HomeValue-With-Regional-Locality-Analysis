## Overview
This project investigates factors contributing to the significant increase in U.S. home values since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research focuses on demand-side factors and includes a regional analysis comparing home value changes among counties with different population densities in Wisconsin and Illinois.

## Key Features
- 📊 Linear correlation analysis of economic indicators
- 🗺️ Regional locality analysis using choropleth maps
- 📈 Data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, and geopandas
- 📉 Statistical analysis using OLS regression

## Code Structure
The Jupyter notebook `home_value_analysis.ipynb` contains all the code for this project, organized into the following sections:

1. Data Import and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Linear Correlation Analysis
4. OLS Regression Analysis
5. Regional Locality Analysis
6. Visualization Generation

## Key Findings
- 🏠 Potential relationships exist between home value growth and several economic indicators.
- 🏙️ Regional analysis suggests a correlation between population density and home value changes, with some notable exceptions.
